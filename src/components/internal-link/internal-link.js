/**
 *
 * This Link component is used to track the origination
 * of a link whether it's from within the application or not.
 * Here the Link Component sets the state of eholdings to true. Checks
 * that 'to' is typeof string. Adds a property 'pathname' to location
 * containing the 'pathname' that was passed in. Then is returns a new
 * <Link to={ location } {...props } /> component
 * with a location hash containing keys of pathname and state.
 *
 * ---  Usage   ---
 * import Link from 'link';
 *
 * <Link to={`/eholdings/providers/${record.providerId}/packages/${record.packageId}`}>{record.packageName}</Link>
 *
 * --- end Usage ---
 *
 * With this added data you can test whether a user
 * navigated to a section of the app via the use of links vs
 * pasting in URL to browser using the router history.
 *
 * ie. In consuming component you can check router history.
 * let historyState = router.history.location.state;
 *
 * If you look at historyState it would be
 * -> Object { eholdings: true }
 *
 * However, if a user was to paste in the url
 * historyState will be undefined which is what we want.
