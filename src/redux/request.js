/**
 * Request reducer creator
 *
 * Creates a reducer that responds to three basic request actions to
 * provide promise-like state properties for the request.
 *
 * - REQUEST_MAKE sets `isPending` to `true` and re-inits the default
 * promise-like properties.
 * - REQUEST_RESOLVE sets `isPending` to `false`, `isResolved` to
 * `true`, and `content` to the action's payload.
 * - REQUEST_REJECT sets `isPending` to `false`, `isRejected` to
 * `true`, and `error` to the action's error property.
 *
 * In order for request reducers to receive actions from a specific
 * request epic, the names of each reducer/epic combo must match
 * exactly. Additionally, it must be unique to a reducer/epic combo,
 * otherwise other epics with the same name will trigger the reducer.
 *
 * if `handleActions` is provided, other actions can be included in
 * the reducer to further alter it's state. When one of the request
 * actions are provided, it acts as middleware, and the resulting
 * state is reduced again by the default request action handler to
 * maintain the promise-like properties of the state.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *   handleActions: {
 *     [REQUEST_MAKE]: (state, action) => ({
 *       ...state,
 *       query: action.data
 *     })
 *   }
 *
 * Then the reducer would take this resulting state and pass it along
 * to the original REQUEST_MAKE handler, producing this:
 *
 *   {
 *     isPending: true,
 *     isResolved: false,
 *     isRejected: false,
 *     content: {},       // or whatever `initialContent` was
 *     error: null,
 *     query: {...}       // data passed to the last request action
 *   }
 *
 * NOTE: if you need to modify the `content` property during
 * REQUEST_RESOLVE, consider using the `serialize` argument of the
 * related epic.
 *
 * if `handleRequests` is provided, the reducer is given the
 * opportunity to reduce _other_ request actions. The keys of this
 * object should be names of other request reducer/epic combos.
 *
 * For example, if you would like to update the contents of the
 * state when a request is resolved for 'resource-toggle-selected'
 * (using `handleActions` from redux-actions):
 *
 *   handleRequests: {
 *     'resource-toggle-selected': handleActions({
 *        [REQUEST_RESOLVE]: (state, action) => ({
 *          ...state,
 *          content: {
 *            ...state.content,
 *            isSelected: !state.content.isSelected
 *          }
 *        })
 *      })
 *   }
 *
 * @param {string} name - name of this request reducer; must match a
 * corresponding request epic
 * @param {mixed} [initialContent=null] - initial `content` property
 * for this request; usually an empty object or array
 * @param {object} [handleActions={}] - additional actions to handle
 * in this reducer; provided request actions are reduced twice to
 * preserve the promise-like state
 * @param {object} [handleRequests={}] - handlers that reduce this
 * state when other requests are initiated
 * @param {object} [initialState={}] - additional initial state to
 * include in this reducer
 * @returns {function} reducer function to use with redux

 * the epic.
 *
 * The `serialize` function parameters will be the `data` and
 * `options` arguments provided to the request action. This should
 * return serialized data to send with the request (params or body).
 *
 * The `deserialize` function will simply receive the payload from the
 * request's response along with the `options` argument provided to
 * the initial request's action.
 *
 * When `defaultParams` is `false`, no query params will ever be
 * appended to the URL. To append query params, simply provide an
 * empty object. Key-values will be used as defaults for the query.
 *
 * @param {string} name - name of this request epic; must match a
 * corresponding request reducer
 * @param {string|function} [endpoint=''] - string or generator which when
 * combined with `okapi.url` will become the request URL
 * @param {object|false} [defaultParams=false] - when `false` this request has
 * no query options; when an object is provided, it will be merged with
 * `data` before being stringified and appended to GET and DELETE URLs
 * @param {function} [deserialize=identity] - transforms data being
 * received from the response before it is dispatched to the reducer
 * @param {function} [serialize=identity] - transforms data being sent
 * with the request before the request is made
